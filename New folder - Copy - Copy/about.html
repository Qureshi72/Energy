                    <p>In December 1990 the Government of Norway and Pakistan agreed on a development cooperation program for Rural Electrification in Northern Areas of Pakistan. The program, which was defined for a 4-year period, includes the development of mini-hydropower stations and the establishment of the Northern Areas Hydro Electro Workshop (NAHEW). The aim of the workshop is to provide facilities for repairs, overhaul, and refurbishing of hydroelectric machines and equipment in the Northern Area of Pakistan. Executing Agency of the project is Northern Areas Public Works Department (NAPWD) and the Norwegian consultant Kvaerner Energy (KNE) and ABB have been contracted by NORAD to assist in establishing the workshop. The combined budget of the NORAD financed Rural Electrification Program in NA is NOK 120 million of which NOK 42 million for the workshop.</p>
                    <p>The NAHEW program comprises construction of the workshop, procurement and installation of tools, and manpower development through theoretical and practical training of workshop staff.</p>
                    <p>The physical installation of the workshop was commissioned in August/September 1993.</p>
                    <p>The physical installation of the workshop was commissioned in August/September 1993.</p>
                    <p>Training started in early 1993 when all employees of the workshop had been recruited.</p>
                    <p>The installation work of machinery at NAHEW was completed well in time and the workshop staff is now capable of carrying out maintenance and refurbishment of old and new mini-hydel units during and after the supervision by KNE and ABB. The main activity of the project was to train the staff, which continued till the end of the project on 31 December 1995.</p>
                    <p>The ultimate objective of the NAHEW (now GBHEW) project is to establish *a self-sufficient mechanical /electrical maintenance workshop" which can service mini-hydel units, primarily in the Northern Areas where NAPWD is responsible for the repair work of all mini and small hydropower stations with altogether around 250 turbines and generators of 100 kW to 4 MW being run under Water and Power Department, Government of Gilgit Baltistan.<p>
